Hi! I am floor, yes it might sound funny that I speak, and just for your information, I have feelings too.
I am sure you want to hear how I feel.
You might think that white coloured ‘me’ (floor) is the best. But it is not. They are the worst because it gets dirty as quick as anything. Do you know how it feels when your dirty, stinky, nasty, and surely filthy feet are rubbed on my face? Ohh, why am I thinking about that, it’s disgusting, you better know that. And despite all this insult, I give you a platform to walk, and if I did not exist, you would not exist too. But there is this one situation that is when babies crawl on my tummy. Hahaha! That tickly. Their small and cute grin puts me in the seventh heaven. The cuteness is so overloaded that it even falls out from my eyes, which are probably tears, I am not sure about that. I help many babies to walk on their feet. They sometimes fall but, at that time I make my belly soft so that they won’t get hurt and can continue to practice walking. I also wash myself invisibly so that babies stay clean while playing on my belly.
Hey! Do you know that I am everywhere? Yep, you heard me correct ‘everywhere’. I follow you wherever you go. Ohh wait, don’t get creeped out. I meant I follow everyone everywhere. Phew! It’s good that I made it clear. And yeah, you can trust me and consider me as your friend.
I am almost different in various houses.
Poor people can’t afford good-looking me, that is why they have ‘not so good looking me’. But at least they respect me by sitting on the ground, but there is one problem, I don’t like the smell when they fart. Ohh! That smell is pathetic. I sometimes even get suffocated when their butt is on my nose and the atrocious part is when they cut the cheese, Holy Crap!
